Driven by a deep passion for technology and innovation, I have spent over a decade as a Senior Software Engineer mastering both Fullstack and Back End Software Development. 

Alongside my engineering career, I am currently undertaking graduate studies in Distributed Software Architecture at PUC-Minas in Brazil, further expanding my skill set and knowledge in the field.

Building upon my five years of focused experience in Mobile Development, I contribute an extensive understanding of various facets of Computer Science. 

My particular strengths lie in Software Engineering, along with Design and Architecture, where I have gained comprehensive expertise.

My proven expertise lies in SaaS, ERP and Business Intelligence, where I have successfully designed innovative solutions and conducted comprehensive systems and data analysis. 

Over the span of the past six years, I have been actively engaged in demanding yet successful transitions in the realm of software architectures. My specific focus has been on facilitating the migration between monolith and microservices structures, demonstrating adaptability to both approaches as needed.

As a leader, I have offered technical guidance and training to both users and teams, continually striving for improvement in software development processes. 

My role also includes meticulous mapping and the execution of the Development Life Cycle, underlining my commitment to high-quality results and seamless project delivery.

In last years I've been working as Softwate Architect and Technical Leader.
